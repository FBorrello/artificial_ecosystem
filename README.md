# Artificial Ecosystem

**Project Overview:**

- **Repository:** [artificial_ecosystem](https://github.com/FBorrello/artificial_ecosystem)
- **Author:** FBorrello
- **Status:** [Current Status - Check GitHub for updates]

## Project Description

The `artificial_ecosystem` project aims to create a self-sustaining, smart environment for aquatic or terrestrial life, particularly focusing on fish tanks or terrariums. It leverages automation to maintain optimal living conditions by integrating various sensors and actuators controlled via a Raspberry Pi or similar microcontroller.

### Key Features

- **Environmental Monitoring:**
  - **Temperature** - Ensures the habitat remains within ideal temperature ranges.
  - **pH Levels** - Monitors and adjusts water acidity or alkalinity.
  - **Water Level** - Manages water changes or top-ups automatically.
  - **Light** - Simulates natural day/night cycles and adjusts for plant growth.

- **Automation:**
  - **Water Pumps** for circulation and maintenance.
  - **Heating/Cooling** systems to regulate temperature.
  - **LED Lighting** with programmable cycles.
  - **Automatic Feeding** to dispense food at scheduled times.

- **Software Integration:**
  - Written in **Python**, using libraries like:
    - `RPi.GPIO` for hardware interfacing.
    - `apscheduler` for scheduling tasks.
    - `Flask` or `Django` for creating a web interface for monitoring and control.

- **Data Management:**
  - Real-time data logging for tracking environmental changes over time.
  - Remote access for monitoring and control, potentially through a web or mobile app.

### Hardware Requirements

- Raspberry Pi (or similar) for control and processing.
- Various sensors (temperature, pH, water level, light).
- Actuators like pumps, heaters, LED lights, and feeders.
- Additional hardware like relays or solenoid valves for controlling water flow or power.

### Software Setup

- Python environment setup on the microcontroller.
- Installation of necessary libraries.
- Development of scripts for sensor reading, actuator control, and scheduling.

### Project Structure

- **/src:** Contains the main Python scripts for control and monitoring.
- **/docs:** Documentation, including setup guides and API documentation if applicable.
- **/hardware:** Schematics or descriptions of hardware setup.
- **/web:** If a web interface exists, this would contain the application code.

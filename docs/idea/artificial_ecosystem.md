## Overview
The habitable artificial ecosystem's main objective is to provide a single family with high resilience and independence through a self-regulating, closed-loop symbiotic system. It will provide shelter, water, energy, and food in abundance.

The system is made of the following primary components, all integrated and designed to create an orchestrated symbiosis.

## Component Details

### Transparent Gored Dome
The dome shall have a diameter of 30 meters and a height of 15 meters. It shall be made of 58 gores with polycarbonate and wooden panels. The polycarbonate panels provide transparency for light transmission, while wooden panels in the northern quarter offer insulation and UV protection. Panels are self-structural with minimal framing.

### Main Water Reservoir
Enclosed under the gored transparent dome shall be the main water reservoir, with a diameter of 20 meters and a depth of 5 meters. It shall contain water and host aquatic creatures like non-carnivorous fish, shrimp, and beneficial bacteria. Integrated into the reinforced concrete walls of the reservoir shall be 6 compressed air cylinders, each with a diameter of 2.5 meters and depth of 5 meters, filled with compressed air at 10+ bar for storage.

### Floating Platform
Floating on the main water reservoir shall be a platform with a circular base of about 20 meters, made of 3 levels: 1 level under water and 2 levels above the water. The underwater level shall include bedrooms, bathrooms, closets, and technical rooms. The first level above water shall include living room, kitchen, office, training/fitness room with a pool. The second level above water shall be an edible vertical garden. This floating platform will rotate following the sun during the day and reset to the initial position after sunset. The rotation is driven by the water flow ejected from the vertical garden on the first level. When water is discharged from the aerobic digester through the garden, it pushes the platform in the opposite direction. The discharge nozzles are oriented by the control system to propel the platform and maintain optimal sun exposure.

### Anaerobic and Aerobic Digesters
Both anaerobic and aerobic digesters shall be integrated in the underground volume between the transparent dome and the main water reservoir. The anaerobic digester shall be the first entry point for all organic matter entering the ecosystem. The aerobic digester will receive from the anaerobic one, process it, and create a liquid nutrient-rich solution for the plants of the edible garden on the second level of the floating platform. Here, the plants will extract the nutrients and part of the water, and the cleaned water will be discharged into the main water reservoir. During the discharging process, the discharge outlets will be oriented so that the discharge water flux will make the floating platform rotate. The movement of water between each stage shall be performed by pneumatic water pumps or air lifters. The compressed air stored in the pressurized dome panels will drive the fluid movements of the system.

### Compressed Air System
The compressed air shall be generated by a solar compressor during sunny days and an electric one during nights or cloudy days. The compressed air shall be stored in 6 cylinders integrated into the main water reservoir walls, each 2.5 m diameter and 5 m deep, at 10+ bar pressure. The compressed air shall be used to drive the water pumps and air lifters, the anaerobic and aerobic digesters, and the water filters.

### Geothermal Heat Reservoir
During the warm season, the excess heat in the air shall be exchanged with the water of the main reservoir. During the cold season, the heat of the water shall be exchanged with the air. This shall represent the geothermal heat reservoir. This system shall maintain the temperature of the anaerobic digester high, allowing nominal natural gas production. The methane shall be used to generate electricity and heat. The electricity shall be used to power the electric compressor and/or stored in the batteries. The heat shall be used to heat the anaerobic digester.

### Edible Vertical Garden
The vertical edible garden shall be made of vertical grow towers and raised beds. Fruit tree roots on the first level of the floating platform and their branches with fruits and leaves shall reach the second level. Plants on the second level shall be fed with aeroponic systems. The plants shall be fed with the nutrient-rich liquid coming from the aerobic digester. Fruit trees shall be fed with the nutrient-rich liquid from the aerobic digester as well.

### Multi-Source Electric Energy Generators
Besides the methane gas electrical generator, the floating platform shall be equipped with a solar photovoltaic panels system. These panels shall be installed on the top of the floating platform. The rotation of the floating platform shall be used to optimize the solar panels' sunlight exposure. The electricity generated by the solar panel system and the wind turbine system shall be stored in the batteries. The electricity stored in the batteries shall be used to power the electric compressor, electric water pumps, electronics, lighting, and AI integrated system controller.

### Electrical Energy Battery Storage
The battery energy storage system shall be made of lithium iron phosphate batteries. The batteries shall be installed in the underground volume between the transparent dome and the main water reservoir. The batteries shall be cooled by the water of the main reservoir. The batteries shall be charged by the solar photovoltaic panels and the methane gas electrical generator. The batteries shall be discharged by the electric compressor, electric water pumps, electronics, lighting, and AI integrated system controller. The batteries shall be monitored by the AI integrated system controller, which shall optimize the batteries' charging and discharging. The batteries shall store enough energy to supply power to the system for a week or more.

### Water Filters and Drinkable Water Reservoir
The water filters shall be made of a series of stages that will output pure water free from harmful substances.

### General System AI Controller
The general AI integrated system controller shall be made of a series of AI controllers that will monitor the entire system using data from the sensors network, analyze conditions, predict needs, and control actuators to optimize operations, ensure balanced symbiosis, and maintain resilience. It will handle decision-making for energy distribution, nutrient flows, platform rotation, and emergency responses.

### Sensors Network
The sensors network shall include sensors for monitoring water quality (pH, oxygen, nutrients), air pressure in the dome, temperatures in digesters and reservoir, energy levels in batteries, plant health, and fish population.

### Actuators System
The actuators system shall include pumps, valves, nozzle actuators for platform rotation, compressors, heaters, and other devices controlled by the AI to adjust system parameters.

## Feedback Loops and Control Systems

The ecosystem incorporates multiple feedback loops to maintain homeostasis:

- **Water Cycle**: Sensors monitor water quality in the reservoir and digesters. The AI adjusts digester processes and filter operations to recycle water efficiently, ensuring clean water for all uses.

- **Nutrient Cycle**: Organic waste is processed in digesters, nutrients fed to plants and aquatic life, excess returned to reservoir, monitored for balance to prevent imbalances.

- **Energy Cycle**: Energy production from solar and methane is stored and distributed based on demand, with AI optimizing usage to maintain self-sufficiency.

- **Safety and Redundancy**: The system includes backup power supplies, emergency alerts for anomalies, and manual overrides to ensure reliability and family safety.

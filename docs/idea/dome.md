# Transparent Gored Dome for Artificial Ecosystem

## Overview
The transparent gored dome serves as the primary enclosure for the habitable artificial ecosystem, providing structural support, insulation, and high light transmission. With a diameter of 30 meters and height of 15 meters, it encloses a hemispherical volume that houses the water reservoir, floating platform, and various subsystems. Constructed from varying gores (59 to 20) with polycarbonate and wooden panels, the dome ensures optimal light for photosynthesis.

## Design Specifications
- **Shape**: Hemispherical dome.
- **Dimensions**: Diameter 30 meters, height 15 meters (radius 15 meters). Surface area: 1,414 m². Projected area: 707 m². Volume: 7,069 m³.
- **Gores**: 355 segments in layers 1-8 (varying per layer: 59,58,55,51,45,38,29,20), subdivided into 9 layers. Last layer is one round cap panel.
- [**Panels**](/docs/idea/dome_panels.md): 356 panels total: 253 transparent polycarbonate panels and 102 wooden panels in varying gores for layers 1-8, last layer one wooden round cap. Panels staggered between layers for improved structural integrity, polycarbonate panels double-sheet with internal/external walls, bent borders for assembly, pressurized to 0.5 bar; wooden panels wrapped in 1 mm white PVC UV-stabilized sheets on both surfaces.
- [**Frames**](/docs/idea/dome_frames.md): Minimal, as panels are self-structural.

## Structural Engineering Requirements
### Load Calculations
- **Wind Load**: Assuming location in moderate wind zone (e.g., 50 m/s gust), dynamic pressure ~1.25 kN/m². Total force on dome surface (~1413 m²) ≈ 1766 kN. Panels withstand this with 1 bar pressurization and bolted connections.
- **Snow Load**: 1 kN/m², total ~1413 kN.
- **Self-Weight**: Polycarbonate panels ~100 kg/m² total.

### Panel Structural Design
- Polycarbonate sheets with bent borders for rigidity.
- Pressurized chambers at 1 bar for additional strength.
- Bolted connections between panels with silicon seals.

### Foundation
- Base anchored to concrete foundation, resisting wind uplift.

## Material Details
### Polycarbonate Properties
- **Transparency**: 85-90% light transmission, UV resistant with coating.
- **Tensile Strength**: 60-70 MPa.
- **Thickness**: 4 mm per sheet.
- **Density**: 1.2 g/cm³.
- **Chemical Resistance**: Resistant to impact, weathering.
- **Lifespan**: 10-15 years.

### Panels
- Double-sheet polycarbonate with internal/external walls.
- Bent borders: External 10 cm inwards, internal 5 cm outwards.
- Pressurized to 0.5 bar for structural integrity.

## Integration with Ecosystem Systems
- **Energy Systems**: Insulates, allows solar gain.
- **Sensors/Actuators**: Basic monitoring for structural integrity.

## Safety Considerations and Redundancy
- **Structural**: Redundant frames, earthquake-resistant design.
- **Pressure**: Relief valves at 1 bar, overpressure protection.
- **Emergency**: Manual depressurization, evacuation routes.
- **Redundancy**: Backup air storage, multiple compressors.

## Construction Methods and Timeline
- **Fabrication**: Panels pre-assembled, frames welded.
- **Assembly**: On-site erection, inflation testing.
- **Timeline**: 6-12 months, depending on site.

## Cost Estimates
- **Materials**: Polycarbonate and wooden panels ~70,000 € (356 panels materials), minimal frames ~10,000 €, foundation ~71,000 €, total ~151,000 €.
- **Labor**: Fabrication and installation ~100,000 €.
- **Total**: ~251,000 € (estimate for structural polycarbonate and wooden dome; actual costs may vary with location and suppliers).

## Environmental Impact and Sustainability
- **Sustainability**: policarbonate recyclable, long lifespan (15+ years), reduces need for replacements.
- **Impact**: High transparency minimizes artificial lighting, double panel design improves insulation (lower U-value), reducing energy for heating/cooling.

## Maintenance and Monitoring
- **Inspection**: Annual pressure checks, frame integrity.
- **Repairs**: Replace panels if damaged.
- **Monitoring**: AI system monitors pressure, alerts for anomalies.

## Future Development
- **Scalability**: Modular design for larger domes.
- **Improvements**: Smart materials, integrated solar cells.

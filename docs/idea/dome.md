# Transparent Gored Dome for Artificial Ecosystem

## Overview
The transparent gored dome serves as the primary enclosure for the habitable artificial ecosystem, providing structural support, insulation, and high light transmission. With a diameter of 30 meters and height of 15 meters, it encloses a hemispherical volume that houses the water reservoir, floating platform, and various subsystems. Constructed from 24 gores with ETFE panels and tubular frames, the dome ensures optimal light for photosynthesis.

## Design Specifications
- **Shape**: Hemispherical dome.
- **Dimensions**: Diameter 30 meters, height 15 meters (radius 15 meters). Surface area: 1,414 m². Projected area: 707 m². Volume: 7,069 m³.
- **Gores**: 24 segments, each comprising tubular frames and ETFE panels, subdivided into 8 panels. Gores are arranged radially from the apex, with frames following geodesic lines for optimal load distribution.
- [**Panels**](/docs/idea/dome_panels.md): 289 structural polycarbonate panels in 36 gores subdivided into 9 layers, last layer one round cap. Panels staggered like bricks for improved structural integrity, each double-sheet with internal/external walls, bent borders for assembly, pressurized to 1 bar.
- [**Frames**](/docs/idea/dome_frames.md): Minimal, as panels are self-structural.

## Structural Engineering Requirements
### Load Calculations
- **Wind Load**: Assuming location in moderate wind zone (e.g., 50 m/s gust), dynamic pressure ~1.25 kN/m². Total force on dome surface (~1413 m²) ≈ 1766 kN. Panels withstand this with 1 bar pressurization and bolted connections.
- **Snow Load**: 1 kN/m², total ~1413 kN.
- **Self-Weight**: Polycarbonate panels ~100 kg/m² total.

### Panel Structural Design
- Polycarbonate sheets with bent borders for rigidity.
- Pressurized chambers at 1 bar for additional strength.
- Bolted connections between panels with silicon seals.

### Foundation
- Base anchored to concrete foundation, resisting wind uplift.

## Material Details
### Polycarbonate Properties
- **Transparency**: 85-90% light transmission, UV resistant with coating.
- **Tensile Strength**: 60-70 MPa.
- **Thickness**: 5-10 mm per sheet.
- **Density**: 1.2 g/cm³.
- **Chemical Resistance**: Resistant to impact, weathering.
- **Lifespan**: 10-15 years.

### Panels
- Double-sheet polycarbonate with internal/external walls.
- Bent borders: External 10 cm inwards, internal 5 cm outwards.
- Pressurized to 1 bar for structural integrity.

## Integration with Ecosystem Systems
- **Energy Systems**: Insulates, allows solar gain.
- **Sensors/Actuators**: Basic monitoring for structural integrity.

## Safety Considerations and Redundancy
- **Structural**: Redundant frames, earthquake-resistant design.
- **Pressure**: Relief valves at 6 bar, overpressure protection.
- **Emergency**: Manual depressurization, evacuation routes.
- **Redundancy**: Backup air storage, multiple compressors.

## Construction Methods and Timeline
- **Fabrication**: Panels pre-assembled, frames welded.
- **Assembly**: On-site erection, inflation testing.
- **Timeline**: 6-12 months, depending on site.

## Cost Estimates
- **Materials**: Polycarbonate structural panels ~135,000 € (289 panels), minimal frames ~10,000 €, foundation ~71,000 €, total ~216,000 €.
- **Labor**: Fabrication and installation ~90,000 €.
- **Total**: ~306,000 € (estimate for structural polycarbonate dome with staggered panels; actual costs may vary with location and suppliers).

## Environmental Impact and Sustainability
- **Sustainability**: ETFE recyclable, long lifespan (25+ years), reduces need for replacements.
- **Impact**: High transparency minimizes artificial lighting, cushioned design improves insulation (lower U-value), reducing energy for heating/cooling.
- **Carbon Footprint**: Estimate 60 tons CO2 equivalent (higher due to cushion manufacturing, but offset by energy savings).

## Maintenance and Monitoring
- **Inspection**: Annual pressure checks, frame integrity.
- **Repairs**: Replace panels if punctured.
- **Monitoring**: AI system monitors pressure, alerts for anomalies.

## Future Development
- **Scalability**: Modular design for larger domes.
- **Improvements**: Smart materials, integrated solar cells.

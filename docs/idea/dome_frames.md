# Dome Frames Detailed Specifications

This document provides detailed specifications for the minimal frames that support the dome structure. Since the panels are structural and self-supporting, frames are limited to base connections and minimal reinforcement.

## Overview
The dome uses structural polycarbonate panels that are self-supporting when pressurized. Frames are minimal, consisting of base rings and occasional supports for stability.

## Design Specifications
- **Type**: Minimal steel or aluminum rings and supports.
- **Configuration**: Base ring for foundation connection, occasional vertical supports.
- **Total Frames**: Base ring ~94 m circumference, few vertical supports.

## Dimensions
- **Base Ring**: Steel tube, 200mm diameter, 10mm wall, length ~94 m.
- **Supports**: Aluminum tubes, 100mm diameter, spaced every 5m, height 2m.

## Materials
- **Base Ring**: Steel (S355).
- **Supports**: Aluminum alloy.

## Structural Analysis
- **Load Cases**: Wind uplift at base.
- **Analysis Method**: Simple calculations for base anchoring.

## Fabrication Process
1. Cut and weld base ring.
2. Fabricate supports.

## Installation
- Install base ring on foundation.
- Place supports as needed.

## Testing and Validation
- Load testing for base connections.

## Cost Estimation
- **Materials**: Steel ~50 €/m, aluminum ~30 €/m.
- **Total**: ~10,000 €.

# Dome Frames Detailed Specifications

This document provides detailed specifications for the tubular frames that support the dome structure. The frames form the skeletal framework of the 24 gores, ensuring structural integrity against wind, snow, and self-weight loads.

## Overview
The dome frames consist of tubular arches arranged in 24 radial gores, with arches spaced every 1-2 meters. Each gore has frames connected at the apex and base, forming a geodesic-like structure for optimal load distribution.

## Design Specifications
- **Type**: Triangular lattice arches made of 3 connected aluminum pipes.
- **Configuration**: Triangular cross-section with vertices pointing inwards, flat side outwards. 10 layers, layers 1-7 with 40 gores each (40 arches per layer), layers 8-9 with 20 gores each (20 arches per layer), layer 10 unified (no arches, supported by lower layers).
- **Spacing**: Arches every 1-2 meters along the meridional direction within each layer.
- **Total Frames**: ~300 arches (layers 1-7: 280, layers 8-9: 40).

## Dimensions
- **Base Arches**: Triangular lattice, each pipe 50mm diameter, 3mm wall, length ~15m, total per arch ~45m of pipe.
- **Mid Arches**: Pipes tapering to 40mm diameter, 2.5mm wall.
- **Apex Arches**: Pipes 30mm diameter, 2mm wall, length ~5m, total ~15m of pipe.
- **Total Length**: ~10,000-12,000 m of aluminum tubing (3 pipes per arch).

## Materials
- **Primary Material**: Aluminum alloy (6061-T6, yield 300 MPa) for lightweight and corrosion resistance.
- **Coating**: Anodized for additional protection.

## Structural Analysis
- **Load Cases**: Wind (dynamic pressure 1.25 kN/m²), snow (1 kN/m²), self-weight (50 kg/m²).
- **Analysis Method**: Finite element modeling for stress and buckling.
- **Safety Factors**: Stress < 0.6 yield, buckling safety factor 2.
- **Connections**: Bolted with high-strength bolts or welded, gusset plates at intersections.

## Fabrication Process
1. Cut aluminum pipes to curved profiles using CNC bending.
2. Assemble 3 pipes into triangular lattice using connectors or welding at joints.
3. Apply anodized coating.
4. Quality check: Dimensional accuracy, joint integrity.

## Installation
- Prefabricate lattice sections off-site, assemble on-site, connect to foundation.
- Attach panels to the flat outer side of the lattice.

## Testing and Validation
- Prototype testing for load capacity and rigidity.
- On-site inspection.

## Cost Estimation
- **Materials**: Aluminum tubing ~30 €/m, connectors ~5 €/m, total ~35 €/m.
- **Fabrication**: ~15 €/m.
- **Total**: ~50 €/m * 11000 m = ~550,000 € (higher due to more tubing, but lighter weight).

# Artificial Ecosystem Project Development Roadmap

### Legend.
- [ ] Pending
- [X] Completed

## Phase 1: Foundation and Core Setup

### Increment 1-2: Project Setup and Initial Documentation 
- [X] Setup version control (Git), create the project structure, and write initial README.md with setup instructions.

### Increment 3-4: Basic Simulation Framework 
- [X] Development of basic simulation logic in simulation/models.py for core components like fish, plants, and environment.
- [ ] Initial setup of visualization tools in simulation/visualization.py.

## Phase 2: Simulation Refinement and Hardware Integration

### Increment 5-6: Advanced Simulation Features 
- [ ] Enhance simulation with more complex behaviors, interactions, and environmental factors.
- [ ] Implement simulated sensors and actuators logic in simulation/sensors.py and simulation/actuators.py.

### Increment 7-8: Hardware Interface Development 
- [ ] Start developing real-world interaction modules in hardware/.
- [ ] Integration of actual sensors and actuators in hardware/sensors.py and hardware/actuators.py.

## Phase 3: Core System Logic

### Increment 9-10: Ecosystem Logic Integration 
- [ ] Develop core ecosystem logic that can operate both in simulation and real-world scenarios in common/ecosystem.py.
- [ ] Ensure the logic can handle inputs from both simulated and real sensors.

## Phase 4: User Interface Development

### Increment 11-12: Web Interface Setup 
- [ ] Begin development of the web interface using Flask or Django in web/.
- [ ] Setup basic templates for user interaction in web/templates/.

### Increment 13-14: Web Interface Features 
- [ ] Implement features like real-time data viewing, control interfaces for actuators, and simulation control.

## Phase 5: Testing and Documentation

### Increment 15-16: Unit Testing and Integration Testing 
- [ ] Develop unit tests for individual components in tests/.
- [ ] Perform integration testing to ensure all parts work together as expected.

### Increment 17-18: Documentation and User Guides 
- [ ] Enhance documentation in docs/, including setup guides and API documentation if applicable.
- [ ] Create user manuals or guides for how to operate the system in both simulation and real-world scenarios.

## Phase 6: Final Integration and Optimization

### Increment 19-20: Final Integration 
- [ ] Ensure all components (simulation, hardware, web interface) are fully integrated.
- [ ] Perform system-wide testing, focusing on performance, reliability, and accuracy.

### Increment 21-22: Optimization and Bug Fixing 
- [ ] Optimize code for performance, especially in simulation algorithms and real-time data processing.
- [ ] Fix any bugs reported during integration testing.

## Phase 7: Deployment and Maintenance

### Increment 23-24: Deployment 
- [ ] Define project requirements in requirements.txt and setup.py.
- [ ] Deploy the system to a production environment or prepare for real-world deployment if hardware is involved.
- [ ] Setup any necessary backend services, databases, or cloud infrastructure.
- [ ] Ongoing: Maintenance and Updates
- [ ] Regular updates based on user feedback, bug reports, or changes in technology or requirements.

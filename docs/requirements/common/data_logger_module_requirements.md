# Implementation Requirements for `data_logger` Module

## Purpose and Scope
The `data_logger` module is intended to provide a mechanism for logging property values of Python classes periodically into a CSV file. It achieves this by implementing a class decorator (`data_logger_class_decorator_factory`) which can wrap a Python class with functionality for:

1. Sampling and logging specified properties at defined time intervals.
2. Automatically managing log file creation and property value caching.
3. Running logging operations in a background thread to avoid blocking the main application logic.

---

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Class Decoration and Property Logging
- Implement a `data_logger_class_decorator_factory` function that accepts two parameters:
  - `sample_rate (int)`: Defines the interval (in seconds) at which the properties of a class should be logged.
  - `log_path (str)`: Specifies the directory path where the log file will be saved.
- The function should return a class decorator (`data_logger_class_decorator`) that:
  - Retrieves all properties of the target class.
  - Logs changes in the values of those properties to a CSV file.

---

### 2. Log Sampling
- The decorated class should:
  - Start a background thread to sample and log property values periodically.
  - Cache the last known value of each property and only log a value if it differs from the cached value.

---

### 3. Log File Management
- Create a log file for each instance of the decorated class using the following filename structure:
  ```plaintext
  {YEAR}_{MONTH}_{DAY}_{HOUR}_{MINUTE}_{SECOND}_{CLASS_NAME}_log.csv
  ```
- The log file should be generated in the specified `log_path` directory.
- The CSV log format should contain the following fields:
  - **timestamp**: The time the property value was recorded.
  - **property**: The name of the class property being logged.
  - **value**: The current value of the property.
- If the `log_path` directory does not exist, the module should create it automatically.

---

### 4. Thread Management
- The decorated class should:
  - Initialize a background thread to handle periodic property logging.
  - Stop the thread when the class instance is destroyed (e.g., during garbage collection).

---

### 5. Error Handling
- Handle file-related errors gracefully, such as:
  - Missing log file.
  - Permission issues during file creation or writing.
  - I/O errors (e.g., disk full, file not writable).
- Log meaningful error messages using the Python `logging` module.
- The logging thread should be stopped in critical failure scenarios (e.g., disk full).

---

### 6. Method Interception
- Implement a `__getattribute__` override to intercept method calls in the decorated class and log informational messages about:
  - Which method was called.
  - Arguments and return values for the method.

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

### 1. Performance
- Minimize the impact of logging on the application by running periodic property sampling in a background thread.
- Ensure the logging interval (`sample_rate`) is configurable to accommodate different use cases.

---

### 2. Scalability
- Support classes with a large number of properties to monitor.
- Handle concurrent decorated class instances, each logging independently to its own file.

---

### 3. Usability
- The decorator should work seamlessly with any Python class that defines properties.
- Ensure that users can quickly integrate the decorator to add logging functionality without modifying their existing class logic.

---

### 4. Robustness
- Handle property access errors (e.g., `AttributeError`) gracefully and log appropriate error messages.
- Ensure that critical operations (e.g., creating the log file) are retried upon common failures.

---

### 5. Portability
- Ensure compatibility with Python 3.6+.
- Make no assumptions about the underlying operating system or filesystem beyond basic POSIX compliance (e.g., directory creation and file writing should work on Windows, macOS, and Linux).

---

## Implementation Details

### 1. File and Path Handling
- The `os` module should be used to construct file paths, check for directory existence, and create directories if needed.
- File writing should use built-in file-handling mechanisms with robust exception handling for `FileNotFoundError`, `PermissionError`, and `IOError`.

---

### 2. Background Thread
- Use the `threading` module to spawn a daemon thread for periodic property sampling.
- The thread should loop at intervals defined by `sample_rate` and terminate cleanly when requested.

---

### 3. Logging Functionality
- Use the standard Python `logging` module to output:
  - Informational messages (e.g., when method calls are intercepted).
  - Warnings for non-critical issues (e.g., skipped property logging due to errors).
  - Errors for severe issues (e.g., failed file I/O).

---

### 4. Class Wrapping
- Create a `Wrapper` class that:
  - Extends the original class being decorated.
  - Adds the logging functionality without modifying the original class behavior.
- Override key methods (e.g., `__getattribute__`, `__del__`) to inject logging logic.

---

### 5. Decorator Behavior
- Ensure the decorator:
  - Can be applied using the `@data_logger_class_decorator_factory(...)` syntax.
  - Works transparently for any class with properties.

---

## Example Usage

```python
from data_logger import data_logger_class_decorator_factory

# Define a sample class
@data_logger_class_decorator_factory(sample_rate=5, log_path="logs/")
class Sensor:
    def __init__(self):
        self._temperature = 25.0

    @property
    def temperature(self):
        return self._temperature

    @temperature.setter
    def temperature(self, value):
        self._temperature = value

# Initialize and use the decorated class
sensor = Sensor()
sensor.temperature = 26.0
time.sleep(20)  # Allow some time for logging before terminating
```

In this example:
1. A `Sensor` class is decorated with the logging functionality.
2. Property `temperature` is logged every 5 seconds.
3. Log entries are saved to a `logs` directory.

By adhering to these requirements, the `data_logger` module will be robust, reusable, and scalable for a wide variety of use cases.

Brainstorm ideas for build an artificial ecosystem prototype in 15000 euro budget.
These are the requirements:
1. water reservoir that act as fish tank;
2. floating on the water reservoir must be a platform that hold plats growing towers;
3. the floating platform contains a biological filter that capture the fish waste and clean the water;
4. the biological filter contained into the floating platform uses beneficial bacterial and earth worms;
5. both water reservoir and floating platform are contained inside a non geodesic transparent dome;
6. water from reservoir, through the biofilter and on the vertical grow towers is moved using compressed air, not centrifugal pumps;
7. the floating platform during the day rotate following the sun;
8. the floating platform rotates thanks to the water discharged from the embedded biofilter, that act water jet like outtake;
9. integrated into the floating platform there are solar photovoltaic panes that will be always oriented toward the sun, because the floating platform rotates following the sun movement into the sky;
10. the transparent dome panes are like bricks that self sustain the weight of the others panels;
11. each dome panel is like a box and it is under pressure, about 2 bar, it act as compressed air reservoir and at the same time the pressure inside make the panel stronger and very stiff;
12. each dome panel is connected with the other with a quick release connection make the entire dome as a big compressed air reservoir;
13. the prototype will collect data during its operations to feed an AI model that will, over time, improve the ecosystem management;
14. to regulate the climate inside the dome the air will be funnelled underground throughout the water reservoir foundation where conducts filled with clay beppels will remove excess of moisture and heat;
15. during summer excess heat will be stored underground, during winter the stored heat underground will be recovered to keep the ecosystem warm;
16. the electrical energy produced by the photovoltaic panels is stored into batteries and inverters provide it to all the electric sub-systems of the ecosystem like: actuators, sensors, fans, valves, etc;
17. the compressed air is provided by a solar compressor that uses a heat chamber where a 10000 suns solar light concentrator is pointed at and increases the temperature of the air inside the heat chamber, this process alternate focus with phases where the focus of the concentrator is diverted, so when the heat chamber, after discharging the excess air pressure into the compressed air main reservoir through an over pressure valve, cools down will intake fresh air through a one way air valve, than the cycle restart again.

# Artificial Ecosystem Prototype: Design Ideas within a 15,000 Euro Budget

To build an artificial ecosystem prototype within a 15,000 euro budget, we need to address each requirement thoughtfully while staying cost-effective. Below, I'll outline ideas for implementing each requirement, ensuring the system is functional, efficient, and within budget.

---

## **1. Water Reservoir That Acts as a Fish Tank**
- **Idea**: Use a 1000-liter IBC tote as the water reservoir and fish tank. These are cost-effective (around 150 euros) and widely available, either new or used. Ensure the tote is food-grade and cleaned for fish safety.
- **Fish Selection**: Choose hardy fish like tilapia, which thrive in aquaponic systems and tolerate varying water conditions.
- **Budget**: ~150 euros.
- **Considerations**:
  - Ensure adequate space for fish to swim and grow.
  - If a larger tank is needed, consider building a wooden frame lined with a pond liner, but this increases costs.

---

## **2. Floating Platform on the Water Reservoir to Hold Plant Growing Towers**
- **Idea**: Construct a floating platform using buoyant materials like polystyrene foam sheets or sealed plastic barrels (cut and sealed for flotation). Build a wooden or plastic frame on top to support vertical plant towers.
- **Plant Towers**: Use PVC pipes with holes for plants, creating vertical hydroponic towers. Water drips from the top, nourishing plants.
- **Budget**: ~500 euros (foam/barrels ~300 euros, frame materials ~200 euros).
- **Considerations**:
  - Ensure stability to prevent tipping under the weight of plant towers.
  - Towers should be lightweight but sturdy, using PVC pipes (~300 euros for pipes and fittings).

---

## **3. Floating Platform Contains a Biological Filter to Capture Fish Waste and Clean Water**
- **Idea**: Integrate a biofilter into the floating platform. Use trays or a box filled with media (e.g., gravel, clay pebbles) where beneficial bacteria colonize to break down fish waste. Earthworms (vermiponics) enhance waste decomposition.
- **Water Flow**: Water from the fish tank passes through the biofilter, and cleaned water is directed to the plant towers.
- **Budget**: ~200 euros (containers ~50 euros, media ~100 euros, worms ~50 euros).
- **Considerations**:
  - Size the biofilter to handle ammonia production from fish (media volume should be proportional to fish tank size).
  - Ensure integration does not disrupt platform buoyancy.

---

## **4. Biological Filter Uses Beneficial Bacteria and Earthworms**
- **Idea**: Incorporate beneficial bacteria and earthworms into the biofilter media. Bacteria break down ammonia into nitrates, and earthworms enhance decomposition, creating a vermiponic system.
- **Implementation**: Use clay pebbles or gravel as media, seeded with bacteria (available from aquaponic suppliers). Add red worms to the media.
- **Budget**: Included in biofilter costs (~200 euros, as above).
- **Considerations**:
  - Maintain proper moisture and oxygen levels for worms and bacteria.
  - Monitor water quality to ensure filter efficiency.

---

## **5. Water Reservoir and Floating Platform Contained in a Non-Geodesic Transparent Dome**
- **Idea**: Build a transparent dome to enclose the reservoir and platform, ensuring sunlight reaches plants and solar panels. Since it's non-geodesic (not triangular panels), opt for a simpler shape like a hemisphere or cylinder.
- **Structure**: Use pressurized transparent panels (see requirements 10–12) to form the dome, ensuring transparency and structural integrity.
- **Budget**: ~2500–4500 euros (see below for details).
- **Considerations**:
  - Ensure the dome is large enough to comfortably enclose the reservoir and platform.
  - Use cost-effective materials while meeting pressure and transparency requirements.

---

## **6. Water Movement Using Compressed Air, Not Centrifugal Pumps**
- **Idea**: Use compressed air to move water via airlift pumps. Compressed air (from the solar compressor, see requirement 17) is bubbled into tubes, lifting water from the reservoir, through the biofilter, and to the plant towers.
- **Implementation**: Install airlift tubes (PVC or flexible tubing) at key points. Compressed air is piped from the dome's air reservoir to power the pumps.
- **Budget**: ~200 euros (tubing, fittings, valves).
- **Considerations**:
  - Airlift pumps are energy-efficient and align with the solar-powered theme.
  - Ensure sufficient air pressure and flow rate for water circulation.

---

## **7. Floating Platform Rotates During the Day to Follow the Sun**
- **Idea**: Rotate the platform to keep plant towers and solar panels oriented toward the sun, maximizing light and energy capture.
- **Mechanism**: Use water discharged from the biofilter as a water jet to create rotational force (see requirement 8).
- **Budget**: Included in biofilter and platform costs (~500 euros total).
- **Considerations**:
  - Rotation should be slow and steady, completing one full turn daily.
  - Ensure low-friction rotation (e.g., floating on water or using a central pivot).

---

## **8. Floating Platform Rotates Using Water Discharged from the Biofilter as a Water Jet**
- **Idea**: Direct water outflow from the biofilter tangentially to the platform, creating torque to rotate it. Adjust flow rate and nozzle size to control rotation speed.
- **Implementation**:
  - Install a nozzle at the biofilter outflow, positioned to push the platform.
  - Example: 1 liter/second flow at 5 m/s velocity provides ~7.5 Nm torque for a 3-meter diameter platform, sufficient for slow rotation.
- **Budget**: Included in biofilter costs (~200 euros).
- **Considerations**:
  - Test flow rate and nozzle design to ensure consistent rotation.
  - Minimize friction for smooth movement.

---

## **9. Solar Photovoltaic Panels on the Floating Platform, Always Facing the Sun**
- **Idea**: Mount solar panels on the floating platform, which rotates to follow the sun, ensuring panels always face sunlight for maximum efficiency.
- **Implementation**: Install 500W of solar panels, batteries, and an inverter to store and distribute energy to subsystems (sensors, actuators, fans, valves).
- **Budget**: ~1000 euros (panels ~500 euros, batteries ~300 euros, inverter ~200 euros).
- **Considerations**:
  - Calculate power needs for all electrical components.
  - Ensure panels are securely mounted and balanced on the platform.

---

## **10. Transparent Dome Panels Like Bricks, Self-Sustaining the Weight of Others**
- **Idea**: Construct the dome using transparent panels that act as structural "bricks," supporting each other's weight. Each panel is pressurized (see requirements 11–12) for added strength.
- **Materials**: Use inflatable transparent panels (e.g., double-layered polyethylene or PVC film) or a framework of pressurized acrylic tubes covered with transparent sheeting.
- **Budget**: ~2500 euros (50 panels at 50 euros each, or acrylic tubes ~2500 euros, sheeting ~2000 euros).
- **Considerations**:
  - Ensure panels are rigid and strong under 2 bar pressure.
  - Use quick-release connectors for assembly and air flow (see requirement 12).

---

## **11. Each Dome Panel Is a Box Under 2 Bar Pressure, Acting as a Compressed Air Reservoir**
- **Idea**: Design dome panels as sealed, box-like structures filled with air at 2 bar pressure. The pressure stiffens the panels, enhancing structural integrity, and the air inside serves as a compressed air reservoir.
- **Implementation**:
  - Option 1: Inflate double-layered plastic panels (e.g., PVC or polyethylene film) to 2 bar, forming rigid cushions. Connect panels with tubes for air flow.
  - Option 2: Use hollow acrylic tubes (10 cm diameter, 3 mm wall thickness) as the dome framework, pressurized at 2 bar, and cover with transparent sheeting.
- **Budget**: ~2500 euros (inflatable panels ~50 euros each, 50 panels; or acrylic tubes ~2500 euros, sheeting ~2000 euros).
- **Considerations**:
  - Ensure materials can withstand 2 bar pressure (e.g., acrylic tube wall thickness ≥ 3 mm for safety).
  - Test airtightness and structural stability.

---

## **12. Dome Panels Connected with Quick-Release Connections, Forming a Large Compressed Air Reservoir**
- **Idea**: Connect each pressurized panel to adjacent panels using quick-release fittings, allowing air to flow between them. The entire dome acts as a large compressed air reservoir, supplying air for water movement and other needs.
- **Implementation**: Use airtight hoses or tubes with quick-release connectors (e.g., push-to-connect fittings) between panels.
- **Budget**: ~500 euros (connectors, hoses).
- **Considerations**:
  - Ensure connections are secure and leak-proof under pressure.
  - Verify air flow is sufficient for all system needs.

---

## **13. Prototype Collects Data to Feed an AI Model for Ecosystem Management**
- **Idea**: Install sensors to monitor temperature, humidity, water quality (pH, ammonia, nitrates), light levels, and other parameters. Use a microcontroller (e.g., Raspberry Pi, Arduino) to log data and control actuators based on readings.
- **Implementation**:
  - Sensors: Temperature, humidity, pH, light, dissolved oxygen (~300 euros).
  - Microcontroller and data logging system (~200 euros).
- **Budget**: ~500 euros.
- **Considerations**:
  - Ensure sensors are waterproof and suitable for the dome environment.
  - Develop a simple AI model (e.g., using Python) to analyze data and optimize management over time.

---

## **14. Climate Regulation: Air Funneled Underground Through Water Reservoir Foundation with Clay Pebbles**
- **Idea**: Regulate dome climate by circulating air through underground channels filled with clay pebbles. The earth moderates temperature and removes excess moisture.
- **Implementation**:
  - Bury 20 meters of 10 cm diameter pipes under or around the reservoir foundation, filled with clay pebbles.
  - Use fans to draw air from the dome, pass it through the channels, and return it to the dome.
- **Budget**: ~500 euros (pipes ~200 euros, clay pebbles ~150 euros, fans ~150 euros).
- **Considerations**:
  - Ensure adequate airflow for heat exchange.
  - If the reservoir is above ground, elevate it slightly and run pipes underneath; if partially buried, run pipes alongside.

---

## **15. Summer Heat Stored Underground, Winter Heat Recovered**
- **Idea**: Use the underground air channels as a geothermal system. In summer, excess heat is transferred to the earth, cooling the dome air. In winter, the relatively warmer earth heats the air, warming the dome.
- **Implementation**: Same as requirement 14, leveraging the thermal mass of the earth and clay pebbles.
- **Budget**: Included in climate control costs (~500 euros).
- **Considerations**:
  - Monitor underground temperatures to ensure effective heat storage and recovery.
  - Insulate pipes to minimize heat loss during transfer.

---

## **16. Electrical Energy from Photovoltaic Panels Stored in Batteries, Powering Subsystems**
- **Idea**: Store solar energy in batteries and use inverters to power actuators, sensors, fans, valves, and other subsystems.
- **Implementation**: Use the 500W solar panel system (from requirement 9) with batteries and an inverter (~1000 euros total).
- **Budget**: Included in solar panel costs (~1000 euros).
- **Considerations**:
  - Size batteries to store sufficient energy for nighttime or cloudy periods.
  - Ensure inverters can handle the load of all subsystems.

---

## **17. Compressed Air Provided by a Solar Compressor Using a 10,000 Suns Solar Light Concentrator**
- **Idea**: Generate compressed air using a solar compressor with a heat chamber and a 10,000 suns concentrator. The concentrator heats air in the chamber, increasing pressure, and cycles between heating and cooling phases.
- **Implementation**:
  - Use a 1 square meter Fresnel lens or parabolic dish (~200 euros) to concentrate sunlight onto a metal heat chamber with a glass window.
  - Cycle:
    1. Concentrate sunlight, heating air and increasing pressure.
    2. Release excess pressure into the dome's air reservoir via an overpressure valve.
    3. Divert the concentrator, cooling the chamber and dropping pressure.
    4. Intake fresh air through a one-way valve, then repeat.
  - Mount the concentrator on the rotating platform to track the sun.
- **Budget**: ~1000 euros (lens/dish ~200 euros, heat chamber ~300 euros, valves/tracking ~500 euros).
- **Considerations**:
  - Ensure materials can withstand high temperatures (e.g., metal chamber, insulated).
  - Test cycle efficiency for continuous air supply.

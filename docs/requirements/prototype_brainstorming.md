Brainstorm ideas for build an artificial ecosystem prototype in 15000 euro budget.
These are the requirements:
1. water reservoir that act as fish tank;
2. floating on the water reservoir must be a platform that hold plats growing towers;
3. the floating platform contains a biological filter that capture the fish waste and clean the water;
4. the biological filter contained into the floating platform uses beneficial bacterial and earth worms;
5. both water reservoir and floating platform are contained inside a non geodesic transparent dome;
6. water from reservoir, through the biofilter and on the vertical grow towers is moved using compressed air, not centrifugal pumps;
7. the floating platform during the day rotate following the sun;
8. the floating platform rotates thanks to the water discharged from the embedded biofilter, that act water jet like outtake;
9. integrated into the floating platform there are solar photovoltaic panes that will be always oriented toward the sun, because the floating platform rotates following the sun movement into the sky;
10. the transparent dome panes are like bricks that self sustain the weight of the others panels;
11. each dome panel is like a box and it is under pressure, about 2 bar, it act as compressed air reservoir and at the same time the pressure inside make the panel stronger and very stiff;
12. each dome panel is connected with the other with a quick release connection make the entire dome as a big compressed air reservoir;
13. the prototype will collect data during its operations to feed an AI model that will, over time, improve the ecosystem management;
14. to regulate the climate inside the dome the air will be funnelled underground throughout the water reservoir foundation where conducts filled with clay beppels will remove excess of moisture and heat;
15. during summer excess heat will be stored underground, during winter the stored heat underground will be recovered to keep the ecosystem warm;
16. the electrical energy produced by the photovoltaic panels is stored into batteries and inverters provide it to all the electric sub-systems of the ecosystem like: actuators, sensors, fans, valves, etc;
17. the compressed air is provided by a solar compressor that uses a heat chamber where a 10000 suns solar light concentrator is pointed at and increases the temperature of the air inside the heat chamber, this process alternate focus with phases where the focus of the concentrator is diverted, so when the heat chamber, after discharging the excess air pressure into the compressed air main reservoir through an over pressure valve, cools down will intake fresh air through a one way air valve, than the cycle restart again.

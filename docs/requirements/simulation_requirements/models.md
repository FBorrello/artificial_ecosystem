# Models Module (`models.py`) Requirements

## Overview

The `models.py` module will define the core entities and their behaviors within the artificial ecosystem,
including fish, plants, and possibly environmental factors. This document outlines the general requirements
for the models to ensure they interact realistically and efficiently within the ecosystem simulation.

## Requirements

### 1. **Entity Classes**
   - **Fish Class**: Must include attributes for species, size, health, age, and behavior (e.g., schooling, predatory).
   - **Plant Class**: Should have attributes for species, growth rate, nutrient requirements, and environmental
   impact (e.g., oxygen production, habitat provision).
   - **Environment Class**: Represents the ecosystem's environment, including water quality, light levels,
   temperature, and nutrient distribution.

### 2. **Interactions**
   - **Predator-Prey Dynamics**: Implement methods to simulate predation, including hunting strategies,
   escape responses, and population dynamics.
   - **Competition for Resources**: Define how entities compete for nutrients, space, and light, influencing
   growth and survival rates.
   - **Symbiotic Relationships**: Model mutualistic or commensal interactions where one or both entities benefit
   without harm to the other.

### 3. **Growth and Development**
   - **Life Cycle Modeling**: Include stages like birth, growth, reproduction, and death. Each stage should affect
   other attributes like size, health, and behavior.
   - **Ageing and Mortality**: Entities should age over time, with age affecting their capabilities and likelihood
   of death from natural causes or predation.

### 4. **Environmental Impact**
   - **Nutrient Cycle**: Model how nutrients are absorbed by plants, transferred through the food chain, and recycled
   back into the environment.
   - **Environmental Changes**: The model should reflect changes in environmental conditions and how these affect the
   ecosystem's entities.

### 5. **Behavioral Complexity**
   - **Adaptive Behaviors**: Entities should adapt their behavior based on environmental conditions and interactions
   with other entities.
   - **Learning and Evolution**: Over time, behaviors should evolve

# Test Requirements for `models.py` Module

## Overview

The `models.py` module contains classes that represent core entities of an artificial ecosystem (Fish, Plant, Environment). This document outlines the requirements for testing these classes to ensure they behave as expected under various conditions.

## General Test Requirements

### 1. **Unit Testing Framework**
   - Use `unittest` from Python's standard library for consistent and systematic testing.

### 2. **Coverage**
   - Aim for 100% code coverage to ensure every line of code in `models.py` is tested.
   - Utilize tools like `coverage.py` to generate and review coverage reports.

### 3. **Test Independence**
   - Each test case should be independent of others to avoid cascading failures.

### 4. **Mocking and Fixtures**
   - Use mocking where necessary to isolate the unit of code being tested.
   - Utilize `setUp` for test fixtures to initialize common objects or conditions before tests.

## Specific Test Requirements by Class

### **Fish Class**
- **Creation and Attributes**: Test if fish instances are created with correct initial attributes.
- **Movement**: Ensure the `move` method updates position and reduces energy correctly.
- **Eating**: Verify that `eat` method increases health and energy based on food's nutritional value.
- **Growth**: Test the `grow` method to ensure size and health increase appropriately.
- **Ageing**: Confirm that the `age_up` method correctly ages the fish and adjusts health.
- **Reproduction**: Check if `reproduce` method creates a new fish with expected attributes.
- **Survival**: Validate `is_alive` method under various health and energy conditions.

### **Plant Class**
- **Creation and Attributes**: Test initial setup of plant instances.
- **Growth**: Ensure the `grow` method increases health as expected.
- **Nutrient Absorption**: Verify that `absorb_nutrients` method correctly adjusts nutrient levels and plant health.
- **Oxygen Production**: Test `produce_oxygen` method for correct output based on health.
- **Edge Cases**: Test behavior with insufficient nutrients or extreme environmental conditions.

### **Environment Class**
- **Creation and Attributes**: Verify the environment is initialized with correct parameters.
- **Temperature and Light Adjustments**: Ensure `adjust_temperature` and `adjust_light` methods modify their respective attributes correctly.
- **Nutrient Replenishment**: Test `replenish_nutrients` to ensure nutrients are added correctly.
- **Edge Cases**: Test boundary conditions like extreme temperatures, light levels, or nutrient depletion.

## Test Environment Setup
- **Development Environment**: Ensure all tests run in a clean Python environment, possibly using virtual environments or Docker containers.
- **Continuous Integration**: Integrate these tests into a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins) for automated testing on code changes.

## Reporting and Documentation
- **Test Documentation**: Maintain documentation for each test case, explaining its purpose and the expected outcome.
- **Failure Analysis**: Document any failed tests with potential reasons

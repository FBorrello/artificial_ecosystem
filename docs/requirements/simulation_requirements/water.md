# Water Simulation Component Requirements Specification

## 1. Functional Requirements

### Water Collection
- **Rainfall Simulation**: Ability to simulate variable rainfall based on seasonal data or user-defined patterns.
  - **Precipitation:** Simulate rain or snow adding water to the ecosystem.
    - **Method:** `add_precipitation(self, precipitation_type, amount)`
      - **Parameters:**
        - `precipitation_type`: String indicating "rain" or "snow".
        - `amount`: Amount of precipitation (in appropriate units).
      - **Behavior:** Adds water to the system, with snow accumulation if applicable, which melts over time based on temperature.

- **Storage Management**: Track water volume in the fish tank, ensuring it doesn't exceed capacity or fall below a minimum.
  - **Water Storage:** Some areas can hold more water than others based on soil type or artificial reservoirs.
    - **Method:** `set_water_storage_parameters(self, shape, surface_area, length, width, depth)`
      - **Parameters:**
        - `shape`: Affects the evaluation of its volume and exposed to air area.
        - `surface_area`: Water area exposed to air.
        - `length`: Water reservoir max length.
        - `with`: Water reservoir max with.
        - `depth`: Water reservoir max depth.
      - **Behavior:** Updates the capacity of water each cell can hold based on soil and structures.

### Water Quality Management
- **Nutrient Tracking:** Monitor and adjust levels of key nutrients (e.g., Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium) in the water.
- **Pollution Management:** Model the accumulation and removal of pollutants or waste from fish.

### Water Circulation
- **Pumping:** Simulate the movement of water between tanks, biofilters, and aeroponic systems with realistic flow rates.
- **Biofiltration:** Implement biological filtration processes including nitrification and denitrification.

### Aeroponic Integration
- **Nutrient Delivery:** Model how nutrients are delivered via mist to plant roots, considering mist frequency and particle size.
- **Nutrient Uptake:** Account for nutrient absorption by plants, reducing nutrient concentration in water accordingly.

### Feedback and Control
- **Sensors Simulation:** Simulate sensor feedback for water quality metrics which could influence system operations.
- **Automated Adjustments:** Implement logic for automatically adjusting the water cycle based on current conditions (e.g., nutrient levels, water volume).

### Evaporation and Losses
- **Evaporation:** Model water loss through evaporation, affected by temperature and humidity.
  - **Method:** `evaporate_water(self, temperature, surface_area)`
    - **Parameters:**
      - `temperature`: The current temperature affecting evaporation rate.
      - `surface_area`: The area of water exposed to air.
    - **Behavior:** Calculates and removes a volume of water based on evaporation rate influenced by temperature and surface area.

- **Leaks or Other** Losses: Optionally include scenarios for water loss due to system inefficiencies or failures.

## 2. Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- **Real-Time Simulation:** Should be capable of running simulations in real-time or at least at a speed where results are timely.
- **Scalability:** Must handle simulations for both small and large-scale systems without significant performance degradation.

### Accuracy
- **Data Fidelity:** Ensure the model's parameters can be tuned to achieve high accuracy against real-world data or established models.
- **Resolution:** Provide options for different levels of detail in simulation (e.g., coarse for system overview, fine for detailed analysis).

### Ease of Use
- **Configurability:** Allow users to easily configure initial states, thresholds, and operational parameters.
- **Interoperability:** Designed to integrate seamlessly with other components of the ecosystem simulation.

### Reliability
- **Error Handling:** Robust to input errors or unexpected system states, with clear error reporting.
- **Recovery:** Ability to return to a stable state after extreme conditions or simulation errors.

### Maintainability
- **Modularity:** The water cycle component should be designed in a way that allows for easy updates or expansion of functionalities.
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation explaining how the system works, how to configure it, and how to interpret results.

### Security
- **Data Protection:** If the simulation uses or generates sensitive data, ensure it's handled securely.

### Usability for Analysis
- **Data Output:** Provide outputs in a format that facilitates further analysis (e.g., CSV, JSON for data scientists).
- **Visualization:** Support or integrate with visualization tools to help users interpret water cycle dynamics visually.

## 3. Technical Requirements

- **Programming Environment:** Primarily Python, with libraries like NumPy for numerical operations, possibly Pandas for data manipulation, and Matplotlib for visualization.
- **Testing:** Include unit tests for each function or method, integration tests for how the water cycle interacts with other system components.
- **Version Control:** Use of tools like Git for version tracking and collaborative development.

## 4. User Interface Requirements (if applicable)
- **Simulation Control:** UI elements to start, pause, resume, and stop simulations.
- **Parameter Adjustment:** Sliders or input fields for adjusting simulation parameters in real-time or before running.
- **Monitoring:** Real-time views of water quality, volume, nutrient levels, etc.

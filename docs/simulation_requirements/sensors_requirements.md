# Implementation Requirements for sensors.py
## General Requirements:
- Python Version: Ensure compatibility with Python 3.7 or higher due to the use of type hints and modern Python 
features.
- Libraries: No external libraries are required, but random is used for simulation in the TemperatureSensor.

## Class: Sensor
### Attributes:
- sensor_id (str): Must be unique for each sensor instance.
- location (tuple): Should represent the coordinates in the ecosystem, 
- format should be consistent across all sensors (e.g., (x, y) or (latitude, longitude)).
- data (dict): Should be initialized as an empty dictionary for storing measurements.

### Methods:

#### __init__(sensor_id, location):
- Must initialize sensor_id, location, and data.

#### measure():
- Abstract Method: Must raise NotImplementedError in the base class. Subclasses must override this method.

#### update_data(key, value):
- Should update data dictionary with key as the measurement type and value as the measured value.

#### get_data():
- Should return the entire data dictionary.

#### reset_data():
- Clears all stored data in the data dictionary.

## Class: TemperatureSensor (Subclass of Sensor)

### Attributes:
- precision (float): Represents the precision of the sensor in terms of temperature measurement.
- temperature (float): Stores the last measured temperature.

### Methods:
#### __init__(sensor_id, location, precision):
- Calls superclass __init__ to set sensor_id and location.
- Sets precision and initializes temperature to a default value.

#### read_temperature():
- Simulation: Uses random.uniform to simulate temperature readings between 20.0°C and 30.0°C. 
- Note: In real applications, this would interface with actual hardware to read temperature.
## Additional Requirements:
- The measure() method should be implemented to use read_temperature() and update the sensor's data:
```python
def measure(self):
    self.read_temperature()
    self.update_data('temperature', round(self.temperature, self.precision))
```

## Testing and Validation:

### Unit Testing: 
- Test initialization with various inputs for sensor_id, location, and precision.
- Ensure measure() raises NotImplementedError in the base class.
- Verify update_data(), get_data(), and reset_data() function correctly.
- For TemperatureSensor, test if read_temperature() returns values within the expected range and precision.

### Integration Testing:
- Test how TemperatureSensor interacts with other components or systems in the ecosystem simulation.

## Documentation:
- Ensure all methods and classes have appropriate docstrings describing usage, parameters, and return values.

## Future Enhancements:
- Consider adding more sensor types (e.g., humidity, pressure).
- Implement error handling for sensor readings (e.g., out of range values or sensor malfunctions).
- Enhance the simulation of temperature or introduce real sensor interface if moving to hardware integration.

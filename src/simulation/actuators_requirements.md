# Requirements for `actuators.py`

## Overview

The `actuators.py` module aims to simulate or interface with actuators in an ecosystem model or a real-world application where hardware control is necessary. Actuators in this context could range from simple switches to complex robotic arms or environmental control systems like fans in a server room.

## Module Requirements

### **General Structure**

- **Class**: `Actuator`
  - **Attributes**:
    - `actuator_id`: String, unique identifier for each actuator.
    - `type`: String, type of actuator (e.g., "fan", "valve", "servo").
    - `state`: Enum or Boolean, current state of the actuator (e.g., `ON`, `OFF`, `IDLE`).
    - `location`: Tuple, representing the position in the environment or system.

- **Methods**:
  - `__init__(actuator_id, type, location)`: Initializes an actuator with its ID, type, and location.
  - `activate()`: Activates or starts the actuator. Should log or return status.
  - `deactivate()`: Deactivates or stops the actuator. Should log or return status.
  - `status()`: Returns current status or state of the actuator.
  - `adjust(setting)`: Adjusts actuator settings like speed, angle, etc., depending on the actuator type.

### **Specific Actuator Classes** (Example: `Fan` and `Servo`)

- **Class**: `Fan` (inherits from `Actuator`)
  - **Attributes**:
    - `speed`: Integer or Float, current speed in RPM or percentage.
  - **Methods**:
    - `set_speed(speed)`: Sets the fan speed to a specified value.
    - `increase_speed(delta)`: Increases speed by a delta value.
    - `decrease_speed(delta)`: Decreases speed by a delta value.

- **Class**: `Servo` (inherits from `Actuator`)
  - **Attributes**:
    - `angle`: Integer, current angle or position of the servo.
  - **Methods**:
    - `set_angle(angle)`: Sets the servo to a specific angle.

### **Error Handling**

- Implement exception handling for common scenarios like:
  - **Initialization Error**: If actuator settings are invalid or if the hardware is not found.
  - **Operation Error**: If an operation on the actuator fails (e.g., due to hardware malfunction).
  - **Status Error**: If there's a failure in retrieving the status.

### **Logging**

- **Details for Logging**:
  - **State Changes**: Log every time an actuator's state changes, such as when it's activated or deactivated. This should include the time, actuator ID, and new state.
  - **Error Conditions**: Log all errors or exceptions raised by the actuators, including the error type, message, time, and actuator ID involved.
  - **Status Requests**: Log when the status of an actuator is requested or checked, useful for debugging or monitoring frequent checks.
  - **Adjustment Logs**: For actuators like fans or servos, log when their settings are adjusted, including what was changed, to what value, and at what time.

- **Format for Logs**:
  - Use a standardized format for all logs, which might include:
    - `timestamp`: For when the log entry was made.
    - `actuator_id`: Identifier of the actuator involved.
    - `action`: What action was taken or what state changed (e.g., "activated", "speed changed", "error").

### **Extended Logging Requirements**

- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Log performance data such as latency or power usage, especially for actuators where these metrics are critical for operational efficiency or health.

- **Security Events**:
  - Include logs for security-related events like unauthorized access attempts or rejected control commands due to security policies.

- **Maintenance Logs**:
  - Log details about maintenance activities, including scheduled maintenance, unexpected repairs, or replacements. This helps in tracking the actuator's lifecycle and planning future maintenance.

- **Environmental Data**:
  - If actuators are sensitive to environmental conditions (like temperature, humidity), log these conditions alongside operational logs for correlation analysis.

- **User Interaction Logs**:
  - For systems where users interact directly with actuators, log user actions, including who initiated an action, when, and what was the command or request.

#### **General Format Enhancements**

- **Standardized Fields**:
  - Ensure all logs include standardized fields like `timestamp`, `actuator_id`, `action`, `user` (if applicable), `status`, and `details`.

- **Log Levels**:
  - Use log levels (like INFO, WARNING, ERROR, DEBUG) to categorize logs, making it easier to filter and analyze logs based on severity or type.

- **Integration with External Systems**:
  - Logs should be structured in a way that allows easy integration with external log management or SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) systems for broader system monitoring or security analysis.

- **Data Retention Policy**:
  - Define a policy for how long logs are retained. This could be based on regulatory requirements or operational needs, with provisions for secure archiving or deletion.

- **Access Control for Logs**:
  - Implement controls on who can view or modify logs. Logs might contain sensitive operational data or indicate system vulnerabilities, thus access should be restricted to authorized personnel only.

# Testing Requirements for `actuators.py`

## Overview

The `actuators.py` module should be rigorously tested to ensure its functionality, reliability, and integration with other systems. Tests should cover all aspects of actuator operation, from basic functionality to error handling and performance under various conditions.

## Unit Testing

### **Test Cases for Base Actuator Class**

- **Initialization**:
  - **Test Case**: Verify that an actuator can be initialized with valid parameters like `actuator_id`, `type`, and `location`.
  - **Expected Outcome**: The actuator instance should be created with the given attributes.

- **State Manipulation**:
  - **Test Case**: Check if the actuator can transition between states (e.g., `ON`, `OFF`, `IDLE`).
  - **Expected Outcome**: State changes should be correctly reflected in the actuator's state attribute.

- **Status Checking**:
  - **Test Case**: Test if the status method returns the current state or operational status of the actuator.
  - **Expected Outcome**: The status should match the last set state.

- **Error Handling**:
  - **Test Case**: Simulate an error during state change and check if it's handled gracefully.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Errors should be logged, and the actuator should remain in its last known good state or revert to a safe state.

### **Test Cases for Specific Actuator Classes** (e.g., `Fan`, `Servo`)

- **Fan Class**:
  - **Test Case**: Adjust fan speed and verify changes.
  - **Expected Outcome**: The fan's speed attribute should reflect the new speed setting.

- **Servo Class**:
  - **Test Case**: Set servo angle and check if it updates correctly.
  - **Expected Outcome**: The angle attribute should update to the set value.

## Integration Testing

- **System Interaction**:
  - **Test Case**: Ensure actuators interact correctly with simulation or real hardware interfaces.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Commands sent to actuators should result in expected hardware or simulated responses.

- **Environmental Dependency**:
  - **Test Case**: Test how actuators respond to changes in environmental conditions if applicable.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Actuators should adjust their behavior based on environmental data inputs.

## Performance Testing

- **Response Time**:
  - **Test Case**: Measure the time taken for actuators to respond to commands.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Response times should be within acceptable limits for the application's requirements.

- **Load Testing**:
  - **Test Case**: Test actuators under high load or continuous operation scenarios.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Actuators should maintain functionality and reliability under stress.

## Security Testing

- **Unauthorized Access**:
  - **Test Case**: Attempt to control actuators with unauthorized credentials or commands.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Unauthorized attempts should be logged and rejected.

## Logging and Monitoring

- **Log Generation**:
  - **Test Case**: Ensure all actions, state changes, and errors generate appropriate logs.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Logs should contain accurate details of events, timestamps, and actuator identifiers.

- **Log Retrieval**:
  - **Test Case**: Verify that logs can be retrieved and parsed by monitoring tools or scripts.
  - **Expected Outcome**: Logs should be accessible and understandable for monitoring purposes.

## Conclusion

These testing requirements aim to cover a broad spectrum of scenarios from basic functionality to complex interactions and edge cases, ensuring the `actuators.py` module is robust, reliable, and secure for its intended use.

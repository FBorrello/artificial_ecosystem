        This method estimates the amount of water evaporated, in liters, based on

        the Antoine equation to calculate the vapor pressure of water and factors
        in external environmental conditions to determine the evaporation rate.
        After the amount of water evaporated is calculated, the method updates the current_volume attribute.

                                    Must be between -10 and 50.
